  Before actually attempting the WODs, I found that it was best for me to read the instructions and watch the screencasts all without doing it myself. I would strongly reccommend focusing on studying and understanding the codes, rather than memorizing them. I feel that this is what helped me to be able to finish in the ample amount of time. When actually attemting them, I made sure to have some links priorly opened to shave some time off. For example, the external links that I hyperlinked some text to in the BrowserHistory1. For all 3, I only took a couple of attempts to make the Rx time because I didn't truly "attmept" it until I knew I would know what I was doing by the time I began my timer/screencast. 
  
  Another piece of advice I would give is to first attempt the WODs without the pressure of a timer running. This allows your mind to be relaxed knowing that it is perfectly okay to stop and look at some notes or refer to the screencast without burning extra time. Personally, I ran through coding the website on my own until I felt comfortable with my ability to then screencast. This was very efficient so that I didn't have to keep deleting and recreating the file in order to have a "clean" screencast to turn in. Overall, I found it was a fun and neat concept to be able to recreate a website that we are given a screenshot of. It is very rewarding in the end and I try to find the creativity within it.

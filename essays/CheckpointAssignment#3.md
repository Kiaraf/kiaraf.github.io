  As for now, the design of our site's shopping cart will be on a separate page after users choose their products, quantities, and after already being previously signed in to their personal account. The user will be able to navigate between the four product pages and click 'add to cart' as they go along. At any time, and on any product page, they will be able to view cart/check out when they desire using a button that will link to that separate page.

  For the data that will be used in the cart, an array will have to be used for information storage. The format may be similar to a table format, and perhaps, include images of the products they chose to add to the cart as well for extra clarity.

   To help avoid access to the applicatoin when the user has not logged in, we intend to require users to log in very early on, and also add a note as they are shopping, that in order to proceed with their purchases, they must make an account with us first. Their information will be stored so that the website can recognize past users, and so that it can also be introduced to new ones. 

  Upon a successful login, we plan to provide personalization by including their name. For example, at the top of the products pages as they are shopping it will say something such as: "Hello, [insert user's name], what will you be buying today?"

  For this assignment, I will be working with a partner. We will have scheduled meetings as well as be in constant communcation. In order to keep consistency within the website, we will establish css styles together. Individually, we will work on the files that must be added. Then, both go over it together to fix errors, adjust things to a mutual liking.

  I am approaching assignment 3 differently than 2 by doing more hands on research and making sure I understand the code without as much confusion. I am also going to set aside more time to work on it and perfect it.

  For the next set of WODs we've been assigned, we definitely strayed away from recreating given websites. This time around, we've learned to build invoices. Instead of inputing content and defining style elements, we are defining variables and using script tags. I think it's a very practical concept to learn in this way. The processes in going about completing the WODs themselves were a bit different though. 
  
  For the BrowserHistory WODs, we were given screenshots of a website that we had to recreate, and from there, I would try to figure out the proper codes to input into my style.css sheet, then I'd see if it turned out the way desired. These Invoice WODs, however, required a bit more thinking and strategizing as to how we defined certain data so that we could properly put it into formats that used "document.write"s. 
  
  Going into it, I would try to attempt recreating the given table on my own, then when I'd get stuck, I'd refer to the screencast. I definitely had to refer to the screencast more for the Invoices than I had to for the BrowserHistorys. There were a lot of technical notation that I need to brush up on and become more comfortable using. When I'd get stuck, I'd eventually find that, somewhere in my code, I was simply missing a semi-colon somewhere, or even a bracket. Due to this, I found that the best way to get through them, was to not rush, especially when copying and pasting codes in order to save time. My biggest tip is to check that everything you need is getting copied, and that you are replacing information correctly!

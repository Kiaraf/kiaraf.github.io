My name is Kiara Furutani. I am from the beautiful island of Kauai. Some things that I absolutely love include singing, traveling, adventuring, shopping, watching netflix, and spending time with my friends, family, and dogs!

After attaining my Assoicates of Arts degree in Liberal Arts on my home island, I then transferred over to the University of Hawaii at Manoa as a Computer Science major. A few class sessions in, I realized that it was not entirely for me. However, I knew that I still held a great interest in technology. I also knew that I wanted to work more with people. With that being said, my counselor guided me toward a path where I could have the best of both worlds - a Bachelors in Business Administration degree in Management Information Systems! I feel that this is the perfect major because, first, there is some sort of business in any field that you enter, and second, technology is ever-growing and ever-changing! 

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous about pursuing a major that many has described as difficult, but I know that could go for pretty much any major out there. I look forward to tackling this challenge to get to that worthy end reward!

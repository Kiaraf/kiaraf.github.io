  To start, I can say with confidence that my programming skills have definitely improved. Prior to taking this class, the only experience I had in code, was through Dreamweaver in my ICS101 class. This took that and totally amplified it and its depth. My thoughts on whether how ecstatic I am about it all, varies. I say this because I feel my mood toward programming bounces from completely opposite sides of the spectrum. In times where I am trying to find my errors or trying to figure out how to execute exactly what I want, I get pretty frustrated. Code is super intricate work. However, once I find that error and execute what I wanted, I feel proud and accomplished! I've come to find that programming involves a lot of "figuring it out" moments, so when you have the "Hey, I know what I'm doing!" moments, that's where excitment sets in. 
   When it comes to my progress with the WODS, I feel that in all honesty, I did find myself referring to the screencasts for them at least once for all of them. I feel that sometimes I needed more info than what the simple instructions were directing us to do. I can say though, that the WODS that built on top of each other were really helpful, as opposed to starting new files for every lesson. As for the labs, I would say the most benficial ones were the labs that I am now able to refer to for the Assignment. For example, I feel that I can confidently put together html and css files, as well as loops. I can also navigate through working with the terminal effciently with things such as node. 
   As much as this class has helped me, I would say that I would still need to go over some things for myself and simply review and practice to really get it drilled in so that I could be ready for the next level. Some things that I felt like worked really well in this class, was first, the way our class is structured. It helped tremendously to be able to go through the labs together with our professor as well as with our peers. I can imagine it would be a lot more furstrating and time-consuming to do it on our own. Doing it with him allows him to teach us tips and tricks in between the lesson, helps us to comprehend what the lab is needing from us, and also gave us instant ability to ask questions on the spot. Another thing that helped, was the requirement of screencasts. This may have been difficult, but this definitely gave us the necessary push that we needed in order to challenge oursleves and assure that we practice the WODS until we can do it in the expected decent amount of time. Since proof was needed, there was no such thing as going around it! 
   As we are now working on our Assignment 1, I am able to see how every lesson does indeed tie in and has lead us to here!

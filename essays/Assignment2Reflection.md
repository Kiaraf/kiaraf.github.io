  In Assignment 2, we essentially took our Assignment 1 and added on files that would incorporate the need for a user to have to either login or register right after choosing products, and before they could move on to viewing their invoice. In this assignment, I learned much better how to add on the right things on to my server.js in order for the login and registration pages to work and how to create a file that will store user information. It may have been difficult, but as I move on to my assignment 3, I will make sure to improve things here and there. 
  
  I did not work with a partner for this assignment, but for the next one I'll be teaming up with someone to make an even better website out of this one. To get help throughout this assignment, I would ask my classmates to clarify certain things, or I'd do my own research and review some examples of the things I was trying to execute. Some things I needed help with, was getting my server to work with my html file pages. *I still need to improve this for the next assignment*
  
  The best way I can describe the differences in this assignment versus the first, is that this one was a lot more "behind the scenes" work, as opposed to more creativity in the first one. For the most part, once we got to this assignment, the aesthetic to our websites were pretty much established. So now, it was time to add in more of the technical stuff.
  
  Throughout everything, I would say I spent the most time trying to figure out how to execute things, rather than doing the actual executing itself. Testing it was quicker, then finding code errors took a bit of time too because of how intricate coding is as a whole. I felt what worked well for me, was adding in the login and registration pages. I made sure to keep things consistent and correctly linked. The problems for me, as I've already mentioned, came with storing and recognizing login information.
  
  If I could go back and do things differently, I would definitely start earlier. It can be a bit challenging when you have other classes to balance along side this class in particular, however, I know that if I create schedules ahead of time, that I would be more productive in figuring things out.
